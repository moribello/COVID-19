COVID-19 Data Visualization
===========================

This project visualizes select local data from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) COVID-19 Data Repository. The visualizations in this project examine local data for the author's current geographical location. Currently, Python code is read and executed in Jupyter Notebook as the requirements for information visualization change; this project should definitely be considered "a work in progress".

Original README.md from JH CSSE is available in the README_original.md file

Pre-requisites
--------------
- Python 3
- NumPy library
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
- Jupyter Notebook

Getting Started
---------------
Open the plot_test02.inpynb file in Jupyter Notebook; several options for plotting are offered and can be run line-by-line. As refinements are made additional python files will be generated and this README file updated.
